	  Libglade is a library that performs a similar job to the C
	  source output routines in the GLADE user interface builder.
	  Whereas GLADE's output routines create C source code that must
	  be compiled, libglade builds the interface from an XML file
	  (GLADE's save format) at runtime. This can allow modifying the
	  user interface without recompiling.
